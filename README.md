# 🤖 CDP Support Chatbot

This project is a Django-based chatbot designed to provide support and information regarding various Customer Data Platforms (CDPs) like Segment, mParticle, Lytics, and Zeotap. It uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to find relevant answers from the documentation of these CDPs based on user queries.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the chatbot on your local machine.

### 📋 Prerequisites

* Python 3.6+
* pip (Python package installer)
* Virtual environment (recommended)

### 🛠️ Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PalGabani/CDP_Chat_bot.git
    cd <your_repository_directory>
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv

    # On Windows:
    venv\Scripts\activate

    # On macOS and Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run migrations:**

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

5.  **Start the Django development server:**

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

6.  **Access the chatbot:**

    Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/chatbot/`.

## ⚙️ How It Works

* **Data Acquisition and Caching:** The `utils.py` module fetches or loads data from specified CDP documentation URLs. It employs a caching mechanism (`cdp_docs_cache.json`) to store fetched data, minimizing redundant crawling.
* **Text Processing and Indexing:** Fetched text is segmented into sentences, and TF-IDF vectors are generated for indexing.
* **Query Handling:** User queries are processed, and TF-IDF vectors are generated.
* **Similarity Matching:** The system calculates cosine similarity between the query vector and indexed sentence vectors to find the most relevant answers.
* **Response Generation:** The chatbot returns the most relevant sentences along with their source URLs, providing users with accurate and contextually appropriate information.

## 🚀 Enhancements

* **Advanced NLP Integration:** Incorporate transformer-based models for enhanced semantic understanding.
* **Interactive UI:** Develop a more interactive and visually appealing user interface.
* **Knowledge Base Expansion:** Extend support to include a broader range of CDPs and documentation sources.
* **Conversation Management:** Implement features to manage conversation history and context for more coherent interactions.
* **Performance Optimization:** Optimize data processing and retrieval for faster response times.
